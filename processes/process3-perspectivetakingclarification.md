## Foundation Process 3
# Perspective Taking & Clarification

## Overview  
A repeatable process for understanding someone’s internal logic, constraints, and motivations using curiosity, consent, and structured inquiry.

## Purpose  
To build empathic precision, reduce defensiveness, and strengthen alignment.

## Steps
1. **Seek consent**  
   “Can I ask a few questions to understand your perspective?”
2. **Ask open, non‑leading questions**  
   Focus on constraints, pressures, and reasoning.
3. **Reflect back what you heard**  
   Check accuracy without adding interpretation.
4. **Clarify gaps or contradictions**  
   Explore gently, without judgement.
5. **Integrate their perspective into shared understanding**  
   Use it to inform decisions, not override your own view.

## Indicators of Good Practice
- The other person feels understood  
- Misunderstandings reduce  
- Conversations become less defensive  

## Common Failure Modes
- Asking questions that are really accusations  
- Using perspective taking to “win”  
- Skipping consent  

## When to Use
- During disagreement  
- When someone’s behaviour seems confusing  
- When building trust  
- When making joint decisions
