# Team Self‑Assessment
## Prompts for Workshops and Async 

This tool helps teams collectively explore how they communicate, collaborate, and create psychological safety. It can be used in facilitated workshops although is ideally supported through an asynchronous survey.

The goal is to surface shared experiences, identify strengths, and understand where the team can improve together. Critically this assessment is to support collective reflection and improvement; results should be used to guide conversations, not to assign blame.

## Workshop Prompts

### Communication
- When does communication flow well in our team  
- When does it break down  
- What topics feel easy to discuss, and which feel difficult  
- How do we respond when someone raises a concern  

### Collaboration
- How do we start work together  
- How do we hand off work  
- What helps us collaborate smoothly  
- What creates friction or confusion  

### Conflict and Disagreement
- How do we handle disagreement  
- What types of conflict do we avoid  
- What happens when tension builds  
- What would help us resolve conflict earlier and more constructively  

### Boundaries and Expectations
- What do we own as a team  
- What boundaries do we need to protect our focus  
- Where are boundaries unclear or contested  
- How do we negotiate responsibilities with other teams  

### Psychological Safety
- When do we feel most safe to speak up  
- When do we feel least safe  
- What behaviours increase safety  
- What behaviours reduce it  


## Deep Workshop Questions

- What is the conversation our team most needs to have but hasn’t  
- What do we collectively avoid, and why  
- What assumptions do we make about each other that may not be true  
- What would our team look like if everyone felt fully safe  
- What is one behaviour we could adopt that would improve trust immediately  

## Asynchronous Survey
Ideally used before team workshop to identify key issues and associated entry points into discussions

### Likert‑Style (1–5)
- I feel safe to raise concerns within this team  
- We resolve disagreements constructively  
- Everyone has an opportunity to contribute  
- We share information openly and early  
- We ask for help without fear of judgement  
- We understand each other’s needs and constraints  
- We negotiate boundaries fairly and transparently  

### Open Questions
- What helps you feel safe in this team  
- What reduces your sense of safety  
- What is one thing we could improve in how we communicate  
- What is one thing we could improve in how we collaborate  
- What support or change would help you do your best work
