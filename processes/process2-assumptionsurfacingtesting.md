## Foundation Process 2
# Assumption Surfacing & Testing

## Overview  
This process identifies the stories, shortcuts, and interpretations we bring into interactions. It encourages people to label assumptions explicitly and test them collaboratively.

## Purpose 
To prevent misattribution, reduce unnecessary conflict, and improve accuracy in understanding underlying drivers.

## Steps
1. **Name the assumption**  
   “I’m assuming that…” or “The story I’m telling myself is…”
2. **Separate assumption from evidence**  
   Clarify what is known vs. inferred.
3. **Test the assumption**  
   Ask the other person whether your interpretation is accurate.
4. **Adjust based on new information**  
   Update your understanding without defensiveness.
5. **Agree on shared meaning**  
   Establish clarity before moving forward.

## Indicators of Good Practice
- Assumptions are surfaced early, not after conflict escalates  
- People correct each other without defensiveness  
- Interpretations become more accurate over time  

## Common Failure Modes
- Treating assumptions as truth  
- Using assumptions to justify blame  
- Surfacing assumptions only when emotions are high  

## When to Use
- During conflict  
- When something “feels off”  
- When behaviour contradicts expectations  
- When clarity is missing
