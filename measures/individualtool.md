# Individual Reflection Tool
## Prompts for Self‑Reflection and Assessment

This tool supports individuals in exploring their own experience of psychological safety, communication, and contribution to team culture. It is designed for private reflection and can be used ahead of coaching, 1:1 conversations, or personal development planning.

The aim is not evaluation, but insight: understanding how you show up, what you need, and how you can contribute to a healthier, safer team environment. It should not be used for performance evaluation; Individuals may choose to share themes with a coach, mentor, or leader, but ownership of the reflection remains with the individual.
