## Contextual Process 2
# Crisis Communication & Stabilisation

## Overview  
Crisis Communication & Stabilisation provides a predictable method for communicating during high‑stress events such as outages, failures, or organisational shocks. It prioritises calm, clarity, and containment before interpretation or blame.

## Purpose  
To stabilise the environment, reduce panic, and create a reliable communication rhythm that protects dignity and trust.

## Steps  
1. **Acknowledge the situation calmly**  
   State what has happened without speculation.
2. **Provide immediate containment**  
   Clarify what is being done right now.
3. **Set communication intervals**  
   Establish predictable updates, even if there is no new information.
4. **Avoid blame or interpretation**  
   Focus on facts and next steps.
5. **Close the loop**  
   Summarise what was learned and what will change.

## Indicators of Good Practice  
- People feel informed rather than left guessing  
- Tone remains steady and non‑reactive  
- Updates are predictable and factual  

## Common Failure Modes  
- Over‑reassurance or minimisation  
- Speculation presented as fact  
- Long silences that increase anxiety  

## When to Use  
- Outages, failures, or urgent incidents  
- Organisational shocks or unexpected events  
- Any moment where uncertainty is high and emotions are elevated
