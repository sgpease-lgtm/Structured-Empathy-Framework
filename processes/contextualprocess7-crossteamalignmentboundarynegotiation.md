## Contextual Process 7
# Cross Team Alignment & Boundary Negotiation

## Overview  
Cross Team Alignment & Boundary Negotiation provides a structured method for resolving friction between teams, functions, or domains. It emphasises clarity of ownership, shared goals, and respectful negotiation.

## Purpose  
To reduce territorial conflict and create reliable, collaborative interfaces between teams.

## Steps  
1. **Clarify shared goals**  
   Identify what both teams are trying to achieve.
2. **Map responsibilities**  
   Define ownership, boundaries, and interfaces.
3. **Surface friction points**  
   Name where expectations or processes diverge.
4. **Negotiate respectfully**  
   Explore options that protect both autonomy and alignment.
5. **Document agreements**  
   Capture decisions to prevent future drift.

## Indicators of Good Practice  
- Clear ownership and boundaries  
- Reduced friction and duplication  
- Teams feel aligned rather than competitive  

## Common Failure Modes  
- Unspoken assumptions about ownership  
- Escalation to leadership prematurely  
- Agreements made verbally but not documented  

## When to Use  
- Cross‑functional projects  
- Ambiguous ownership  
- Repeated friction between teams
