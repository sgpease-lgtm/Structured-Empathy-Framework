# Contextual Processes

A positive culture is truly embedded or significantly impaired in the difficult moments. It is therefore critical that recognise the importance of handling these difficult moments, and if possible be prepared in advanced.  The idea of the _contextual processes_ is to have short, simple, processes that can be used to prepare for these moments, where empathy, clarity, and psychological safety must be applied with precision.

These processes are:

### [1 - Decision Making Under Ambiguity](contextualprocess1-decisionmakingunderambiguity.md)
A structured approach for navigating unclear, incomplete, or conflicting information.  
It emphasises shared exploration, explicit risk framing, and transparent rationale.
What it enables:
-	Reduced anxiety in uncertain environments
-	Faster alignment on next steps
-	Decisions that balance pace with psychological safety

### [2 - Crisis Communication & Stabilisation](contextualprocess2-crisiscommunicationstabilisation.md)
A predictable method for communicating during high stress events such as outages, failures, or organisational shocks.  
It prioritises calm, clarity, and containment before interpretation or blame.
What it enables:
-	Reduced panic and rumour
-	Trust in leadership during instability
-	A consistent tone that protects dignity under pressure

### [3 - Role Transitions & Onboarding](contextualprocess3-roletransitionsonboarding.md)
A process for supporting people through role changes, new responsibilities, or team transitions.  
It focuses on expectations, emotional impact, and early psychological safety.
What it enables:
-	Faster integration
-	Reduced uncertainty and ‘imposter syndrome’ risk
-	Clear mutual expectations

### [4 - Difficult Performance Conversations](contextualprocess4-difficultperformanceconversations.md)
A structured method for addressing underperformance or behavioural concerns without damaging trust.  
It balances candour with compassion and ensures the conversation remains grounded in observable evidence.
What it enables:
-	Fair, consistent handling of performance issues
-	Reduced defensiveness
-	A path to improvement that preserves dignity

### [5 - High Stakes Feedback Delivery](contextualprocess5-highstakesfeedbackdelivery.md)
A process for giving feedback that carries significant emotional or organisational weight.  
It emphasises preparation, consent, and clarity of intent.
What it enables:
-	Feedback that lands cleanly
-	Reduced misinterpretation
-	Stronger relationships through honesty

### [6 - Conflict De Escalation & Reset](contextualprocess6-conflictdeescalationreset.md)
A repeatable approach for interrupting escalating tension and resetting the interaction.  
It focuses on slowing pace, restoring shared reality, and re establishing psychological safety.
What it enables:
-	Prevention of fractured relationships
-	Faster recovery from heated moments
-	A culture where conflict is navigable

### [7 - Cross Team Alignment & Boundary Negotiation](contextualprocess7-crossteamalignmentboundarynegotiation.md)
A structured method for resolving friction between teams, functions, or domains.  
It emphasises clarity of ownership, shared goals, and respectful negotiation.
What it enables:
-	Reduced territorial conflict
-	Clearer interfaces between teams
-	More reliable collaboration

### [8 - Prioritisation & Workload Triage](contextualprocess8-prioritisationworkloadtriage.md)
A process for handling overload, competing demands, or shifting priorities.  
It uses transparent criteria and shared decision making to avoid burnout and confusion.
What it enables:
-	Reduced overwhelm
-	Fair distribution of work
-	Predictable decision making under pressure

### [9 - Repair After Harm or Misstep](contextualprocess9-repairafterharmormisstep.md)
A structured approach for acknowledging harm, apologising effectively, and restoring trust.  
It focuses on accountability without shame and repair without defensiveness.
What it enables:
-	Faster relationship recovery
-	Reduced lingering resentment
-	A culture where mistakes are survivable

### [10 - Strategic Pause & Reassessment](contextualprocess10-strategicpausereassessment.md)
A process for stepping back when momentum is carrying the organisation in the wrong direction.  
It emphasises reflection, reframing, and deliberate re entry.
What it enables:
-	Prevention of drift
-	More intentional decision making
-	Space for insight and recalibration
