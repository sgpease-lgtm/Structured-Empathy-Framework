# Difficult Performance Conversations

## Overview  
Difficult Performance Conversations provide a structured method for addressing underperformance or behavioural concerns without damaging trust. It balances candour with compassion and grounds the conversation in observable evidence.

## Purpose  
To ensure performance issues are handled fairly, consistently, and in a way that preserves dignity.

## Steps  
1. **Prepare with evidence**  
   Gather specific, observable examples.
2. **State intent clearly**  
   Explain the purpose of the conversation.
3. **Share observations neutrally**  
   Avoid judgement or interpretation.
4. **Invite their perspective**  
   Create space for context and clarification.
5. **Agree next steps**  
   Define actions, support, and review points.

## Indicators of Good Practice

- Clear, actionable next steps are agreed  

## Common Failure Modes

## When to Use  
- Repeated behavioural concerns  
- Declining performance
