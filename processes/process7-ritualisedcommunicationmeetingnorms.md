## Foundation Process 7
# Ritualised Communication & Meeting Norms

## Overview  
Predictable, repeatable communication patterns that embed psychological safety into everyday operations.

## Purpose  
To reduce interpersonal risk, create consistency across teams, and ensure behaviour holds under pressure.

## Steps
1. **Establish shared rituals**  
   Check‑ins, structured rounds, decision protocols.
2. **Apply them consistently**  
   Especially during conflict or urgency.
3. **Use inclusive facilitation**  
   Ensure all voices are heard.
4. **Protect the norms**  
   Intervene when behaviours drift.
5. **Review and refine**  
   Adapt rituals as the team evolves.

## Indicators of Good Practice
- Meetings feel predictable and fair  
- Dominant voices don’t crowd out others  
- Conflict is handled safely  

## Common Failure Modes
- Rituals used only when convenient  
- Facilitators avoiding intervention  
- Rituals becoming performative  

## When to Use
- All recurring meetings  
- Decision‑making forums  
- Conflict‑prone environments
