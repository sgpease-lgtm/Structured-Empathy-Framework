# Structured Empathy Framework - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Please submit questions via [sef@fortytwofold.com](mailto:sef@fortytwofold.com).

### Q: What is the Structured Empathy Framework trying to achieve?

A: The Framework aims to enable organisations to deliver strategy through a culture based on a proactive practical, teachable, and repeatable empathy based model to improve psychological safety. It gives people a shared language and set of tools for understanding one another, reducing friction, and improving collaboration and trust in complex or high‑pressure environments.

### Q: Who is the Framework for?

A: Anyone who works with other humans! It’s designed to be accessible to leaders, teams, facilitators, researchers, and practitioners across sectors, without needing technical or psychological expertise.

### Q: Why is the Framework structured the way it is?

A: The structure reflects what consistently helps people communicate, collaborate, and feel safe. Each component is designed to be actionable, evidence‑informed, and easy to apply in real conversations.

### Q: Is this a finished product?

A: No. The Framework is intentionally iterative and will evolve as people use it, test it, and share what works. Please - we would value your own [contribution](contributing.md) as you review, use, exploit and develop your own practices based upon it.

### Q: Is just AI slop?

A: No! This is developed by humans based on research and experience. While AI will have been used to help build and format some of the site, its is always driven and carefully reviewed by humans.  

### Q: How can I contribute?

A: You can propose edits, suggest examples, raise issues, or share insights from your own practice. Contributions don’t need to be perfect — they just need to be thoughtful and constructive. You can understand how to contribute via the [contributions](contributing.md) page.

### Q: What if I’m not confident about making changes?

A: You can start small. Even pointing out something unclear is a valuable contribution. Changes are human reviewed - so you also cannot break anything - so give it a go! We really appreciate any contribution you make, however small.

### Q: How is quality maintained if anyone can contribute?

A: All changes go through review. Nothing is added to the main version until it has been checked for clarity, accuracy, and alignment with the Framework’s undelrying foundations.

### Q: Is the Framework based on academic research?

A: The Framework draws on a wide range of established research in psychology, communication, leadership, and systems thinking, but it is not tied to any single theory.

### Q: Can I use the Framework in my organisation or training?

A: Yes. The Creative Commons licence allows you to use, adapt, and share the Framework — including in professional settings — as long as you provide attribution and share any derivative work under the same licence. 

The specific license file for the Structure Empathy Framework is maintained in the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/fortytwofold/Structured-Empathy-Framework/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

### Q: Will the Framework always be free?

A: Yes. The Framework itself will always remain free and open. People may build tools, workshops, or services around it, but the core content will remain accessible to everyone.

### Q: Who maintains the Framework?

A: [Forty Two Fold](https://www.fortytwofold.com) steward the Framework, review contributions, and ensure consistency. Their role is to guide and support, not gatekeep.

### Q: Why “Structured Empathy”?

A: Because empathy is powerful but often vague. The Framework gives it shape — turning something intuitive into something people can learn, practice, and improve together.

### Q: Do I need to understand technology to contribute?

A: No. Contributions can be as simple as suggesting clearer wording, offering examples, or raising questions. The GitHub workflow is just a way to keep everything organised and transparent.

### Q: Why is the framework opensource?

A: Our theory/hypothesis is that an open‑source model makes the Structured Empathy Framework more credible and (hopefully) widely adopted, because people can see exactly how it works and contribute to its evolution rather than taking it on trust.

### Q: Why use GitHub and all this techie stuff?

A: GitHub is the largest and primary site for building and collaborating on OpenSource material. By making the Structured Empathy Framework opensource, and part of the largest community, we believe it maximises the ability for anyone to contribute and use the Framework.
