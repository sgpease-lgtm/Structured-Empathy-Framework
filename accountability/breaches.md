# Handling Breaches  
## Maintaining psychological safety while enforcing standards

Organisations need clear standards to function effectively, assure quality and drive performance. When those standards are breached - whether through error, oversight, or intentional behaviour — the response must balance accountability with fairness, learning, and psychological safety.

A just and empathy focused approach ensures that breaches are handled proportionately, transparently, and with an understanding of how human factors, system design, and contextual pressures contribute to behaviour. This avoids blame driven responses that damage trust, while still upholding the standards required for quality, high performance, safe, effective, and ethical outcomes.

## Principles for Handling Breaches

### Distinguish between types of behaviour
A just culture differentiates between:
- **Human error** – unintentional actions, slips, lapses  
- **At‑risk behaviour** – taking shortcuts or decisions without fully appreciating the risk  
- **Reckless behaviour** – conscious disregard of known standards or safety  

Each requires a different response. Treating all breaches the same undermines fairness and psychological safety.

## Understand perspectives, needs, and constraints
Before responding to a breach, leaders be grounded in understanding, not assumption. To this end, they explore:
- how the individual interpreted the situation  
- what pressures or constraints they were under  
- what information they had at the time  
- what needs they were trying to meet  
- what systemic factors shaped their choices  

## Focus on learning before judgement
Learning focuses on addressing root causes, strengthening performance and reducing recurrence. Therefore its important to uncover what breaches reveal about:
- unclear expectations  
- ambiguous boundaries  
- gaps in training  
- workload pressures  
- conflicting priorities  
- systemic design flaws

## A Structured Approach to Handling Breaches

### 1. Establish the facts
- What happened  
- What was expected  
- What was the impact  
- What standards or boundaries were involved  

This is descriptive, not evaluative.

### 2. Explore interpretation and context
- How did the individual understand the situation  
- What information were they acting on  
- What pressures, constraints, or assumptions influenced their actions  
- What needs were they trying to meet  

This prevents hindsight bias and supports fairness.

### 3. Identify systemic contributors
- Was the process unclear  
- Were boundaries ambiguous  
- Was workload excessive  
- Were tools or resources inadequate  
- Were roles or responsibilities misunderstood  

Seperating out the significant role system factors often play in breaches helps depersonalise and assure focus in the correct area.

### 4. Determine the category of behaviour
- Human error  
- At‑risk behaviour  
- Reckless behaviour  

This classification guides the proportional response.

### 5. Agree on actions
Actions must be transparent, proportionate, and focused on improvement; these may include:
- clarifying expectations  
- improving processes or documentation  
- adjusting workload or resourcing  
- providing training or support  
- reinforcing boundaries  
- formal consequences (only where behaviour is reckless or repeated)  

### 6. Close the loop
- Communicate outcomes clearly  
- Explain the reasoning behind decisions  
- Reinforce the organisation’s commitment to fairness and learning  
- Capture insights for future prevention  


## Maintaining Psychological Safety Throughout the Process

### Communicate intent clearly
People need to know:
- the purpose is understanding and improvement  
- the process is fair and consistent  
- they will be heard before conclusions are drawn  

### Avoid blame language
Focus on:
- what happened  
- why it made sense at the time  
- what can be improved  

Avoid:
- “Why did you do that”  
- “You should have known better”  

### Protect dignity
- Hold conversations privately  
- Avoid public speculation  
- Share only necessary information  

### Reinforce shared standards
Psychological safety is not permissiveness.  
Clear standards, fairly enforced, *increase* safety, quality and performance.
