## Foundation Process 5
# Constructive Challenge & Conflict Navigation

## Overview  
A structured approach to raising concerns, disagreeing, and navigating tension without damaging dignity or trust.

## Purpose  
To turn conflict into insight and ensure challenge strengthens decisions rather than undermining relationships.

## Steps
1. **Prepare with evidence**  
   Ground challenge in observation, not emotion.
2. **State intent**  
   “I’m raising this because I want us to succeed.”
3. **Describe the concern clearly**  
   Avoid generalisations or character judgements.
4. **Invite their perspective**  
   Treat disagreement as data.
5. **Co‑create a path forward**  
   Agree on actions, not just understanding.

## Indicators of Good Practice
- Challenge feels safe, not risky  
- Disagreements lead to better decisions  
- Dignity is preserved  

## Common Failure Modes
- Using challenge as a weapon  
- Avoiding conflict until it becomes unmanageable  
- Confusing honesty with brutality  

## When to Use
- When decisions need scrutiny  
- When behaviour impacts others  
- When misalignment persists
