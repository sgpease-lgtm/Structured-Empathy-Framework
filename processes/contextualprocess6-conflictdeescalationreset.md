# Conflict De-Escalation & Reset

## Overview  
Conflict De‑Escalation & Reset provides a repeatable approach for interrupting escalating tension and restoring psychological safety. It focuses on slowing pace, re‑establishing shared reality, and preventing relational rupture.

## Purpose

## Steps  
1. **Pause the interaction**  
   Interrupt escalation with a calm, neutral signal.
2. **Name what is happening**  
   Acknowledge rising tension without blame.
3. **Re‑establish shared reality**  
   Clarify what each person is trying to achieve.
4. **Reset tone and pace**
