## Foundation Process 4
# Boundary Setting & Maintenance

## Overview  
A process for articulating, negotiating, and respecting boundaries—both personal and organisational.

## Purpose  
To prevent over‑identification, emotional labour, and blurred expectations while enabling sustainable collaboration.

## Steps
1. **Identify the boundary**  
   What is the limit you need to protect?
2. **State it clearly and respectfully**  
   Use direct, non‑apologetic language.
3. **Explain the rationale (optional)**  
   Provide context without over‑justifying.
4. **Negotiate if needed**  
   Explore alternatives that respect both sides.
5. **Maintain the boundary consistently**  
   Reinforce calmly when tested.

## Indicators of Good Practice
- Boundaries are clear, predictable, and respected  
- People feel safe to say “no”  
- Expectations are explicit  

## Common Failure Modes
- Setting boundaries only after burnout  
- Being vague or indirect  
- Treating boundaries as barriers  

## When to Use
- When workload, emotional load, or expectations become unsustainable  
- When roles or responsibilities blur  
- When conflict escalates due to unclear limits
