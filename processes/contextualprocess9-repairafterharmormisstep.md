## Contextual Process 9
# Repair After Harm or Misstep

## Overview  
Repair After Harm or Misstep provides a structured approach for acknowledging harm, apologising effectively, and restoring trust. It focuses on accountability without shame and repair without defensiveness.

## Purpose  
To enable relationships to recover quickly and fairly after mistakes or breaches of trust.

## Steps  
1. **Acknowledge the harm**  
   Name what happened without minimising.
2. **Take responsibility**  
   Own your part clearly and without justification.
3. **Listen to impact**  
   Understand how the other person was affected.
4. **Offer repair**  
   Identify actions that rebuild trust.
5. **Agree how to move forward**  
   Define expectations and boundaries for the future.

## Indicators of Good Practice  
- The harmed party feels heard and respected  
- Accountability is taken without shame  
- Trust begins to rebuild  

## Common Failure Modes
