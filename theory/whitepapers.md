## Why Technical Debt isn't the problem... Silence is.
**Source:** Forty Two Fold
**URL:** [https://fortytwofold.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Whitepaper-TechnicalDebt-FortyTwoFold-vA.pdf](https://fortytwofold.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Whitepaper-TechnicalDebt-FortyTwoFold-vA.pdf)  

This white paper argues that technical debt is rarely the true problem, rather silence is, because engineers often lack psychologically safe spaces to surface risks early. It outlines a structured, empathy driven approach that helps teams uncover, assess, and address technical debt with clarity, compassion, and delivery confidence.
