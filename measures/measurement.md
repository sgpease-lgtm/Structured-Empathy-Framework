# Measurement Methods
## Approaches to measuring Psychological Safety

Psychological safety is a cultural condition rather than a single metric, so measurement requires a blend of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Building on the [indicators](indicators.md), this page outlines practical tools for assessing psychological safety, trust, collaboration quality, and the effectiveness of Structured Empathy practices across teams and organisations.

The aim is not to produce a score, but to generate insight that supports reflection, alignment, and continuous improvement.

## Self Assessments

### Individual Reflection Tool
Prompts individuals to reflect on:
- How safe they feel speaking up  
- How they respond to mistakes  
- How they contribute to team safety  
- What they need from others  

**Format:** private self‑assessment  
**Interpretation:** to be used as input to coaching or 1:1 conversations, **_not as performance data_**.

The detailed [Individual Reflection Tool](individualtool.md) page includes extensive questions to prompt reflection.

### Team Self‑Assessment
A collective reflection on:
- How the team communicates  
- How conflict is handled  
- How decisions are made  
- How people feel during collaboration  

**Format:** workshop or asynchronous form  
**Interpretation:** focus on shared themes rather than individual responses.

The detailed [Team Self-Assessment Tool](teamtool.md) page includes promops for workshops, probing questions, and survey style self-assessment questions.

## Organisational Surveys

### Indicator Surveys
Short, frequent check‑ins that track:
- Trust  
- Voice  
- Inclusion  
- Workload  
- Team climate  

**Format:** 5–10 questions  
**Interpretation:** trends matter more than single data points.

The [sample indicator survey questionare](indicatorsample.md) can be used to build a suitable survey.

### Deep‑Dive Surveys
More comprehensive assessments covering:
- How well perspectives are understood  
- How clearly needs are expressed  
- How boundaries are negotiated  
- How conflict is surfaced and resolved
- Feeling of Psychological safety  
- Leadership behaviours  
- Wellbeing  

**Format:** Likert scale + open questions  
**Interpretation:** look for gaps between groups (e.g., leaders vs teams).

The [sample deep-dive survey questionare](deepdivesample.md) can be used to build a suitable survey.

## Notes on Interpreting Results

### Look for patterns, not perfection
Psychological safety fluctuates. The goal is to identify trends, and continiously improve, not to achieve a perfect score.

### Combine qualitative and quantitative data
Numbers show *where* to look; stories explain *why*.

### Avoid using results punitively
Measurement should build trust, not erode it. Punitive use of data risks both undermining pscyholgoical safety and reduces honesty in future surveys.

### Compare teams with care
Comparisons can be helpful but should never be used competitively.

### Track change over time
The most meaningful indicator is movement:
- Are things improving  
- Are they stable  
- Are they declining  

### Use results to guide action
Measurement should lead to converstations, reflections or improvements.
