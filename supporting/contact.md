# Contact Information  
 
The Structured Empathy Framework project is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/fortytwofold/Structured-Empathy-Framework/); for more information on how to contribute and develop the framework, please have a look at the [Contributing](contributing.md) page. This is the primarily tool used for developing, improving and collaborating around the Framework itself.  

[Forty Two Fold](https://www.fortytwofold.com) developed the original framework, are maintainers of the project, and actively use the framework in all of their work. If you are looking for help exploring how the framework could be used in your organisation, the practitioners at Forty Two Fold would be keen to try and support you.  In the first instance it is best to email them at [sef@fortytwofold.com](sef@fortytwofold.com). 
  
This is the final page of the framework. You can return to the [contents page](../contents/contents.md) by clicking the 'Structured Empathy Framework' title at the top of the page.
