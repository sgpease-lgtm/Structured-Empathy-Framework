## Contextual Process 3
# Role Transitions & Onboarding

## Overview  
Role Transitions & Onboarding supports people through changes in role, responsibility, or team membership. It focuses on expectations, emotional impact, and early psychological safety.

## Purpose  
To reduce uncertainty, accelerate integration, and ensure transitions are handled with clarity and care.

## Steps  
1. **Clarify expectations early**  
   Define responsibilities, boundaries, and success criteria.
2. **Acknowledge emotional impact**  
   Normalise uncertainty, excitement, or apprehension.
3. **Establish support structures**  
   Identify mentors, peers, and check‑in rhythms.
4. **Create early wins**  
   Provide achievable tasks that build confidence.
5. **Review progress collaboratively**  
   Adjust expectations as understanding deepens.

## Indicators of Good Practice  
- The individual feels supported and oriented  
- Expectations are explicit and shared  
- Early feedback loops are active and constructive  

## Common Failure Modes  
- Assuming people “just know” what to do  
- Overloading new joiners with complexity  
- Ignoring emotional or relational aspects of transition  

## When to Use  
- New hires or internal moves  
- Changes in scope or responsibility  
- Team restructures or leadership transitions
