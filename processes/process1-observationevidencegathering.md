# Foundation Process 1
# Observation & Evidence Gathering

### Overview  
Observation & Evidence Gathering is the disciplined practice of grounding understanding in what is *observable*, not what is assumed. It focuses on behaviours, language, context, and patterns to create a shared factual basis before interpretation begins.

### Purpose 
To reduce projection, prevent narrative drift, and ensure conversations start from a stable, shared reality.

### Steps
1. **Describe what you observed**  
   Focus on words, tone, timing, and context.
2. **Avoid interpretation**  
   Do not add meaning, motive, or emotional inference.
3. **Check for patterns**  
   Identify whether this is a one‑off or part of a trend.
4. **Share observations neutrally**  
   Use language that is factual, specific, and non‑accusatory.
5. **Invite confirmation or correction**  
   Treat your observations as data, not conclusions.

### Indicators of Good Practice
- Statements begin with “I noticed…” rather than “You always…”  
- Observations are specific, time‑bound, and verifiable  
- Others recognise the description as accurate  

### Common Failure Modes
- Mixing observation with judgement  
- Using vague or emotionally loaded language  
- Treating assumptions as facts  

## **When to Use**
- Before giving feedback  
- When conflict emerges  
- When clarifying misunderstandings  
- When preparing for a difficult conversation
