title: Introduction to the Structured Empathy Framework

# Introduction
## A practical, open framework for organisations who want to lead with empathy and deliver with confidence.
Psychological safety isn’t a “nice to have.” It’s the foundation of high performing teams, resilient organisations, and leadership cultures where people think boldly, challenge constructively, and innovate without fear. Yet most organisations struggle to build it consistently. Efforts are often ad hoc, personality driven, or dependent on individual leaders.
The Structured Empathy Framework changes that.

It provides a clear, evidence informed maturity model that helps organisations understand where they are today, where they want to be, and how to get there, with practical tools, shared language, and repeatable behaviours that make psychological safety real, measurable, and sustainable.
- A five level maturity model that shows how psychological safety evolves from inconsistent and personality driven to a strategic organisational capability.
- A shared language for leaders, teams, and practitioners to talk about empathy, conflict, accountability, and culture.
- Practical guidance for embedding empathy into strategy, leadership behaviours, operational rhythms, and everyday decision making.
- A way to measure progress, identify gaps, and build a roadmap for improvement.
- An open, accessible resource that any organisation can adopt, adapt, and build upon.

### Why Structured Empathy?
Structured Empathy is is just that – structured, teachable, measurable – and when embedded intentionally, it becomes a strategic differentiator.
Organisations that invest in psychological safety consistently see:
- Higher performance and innovation-
-  Stronger collaboration and trust
-  Better decision making
-  More resilient teams
-  Reduced conflict and rework
- Improved wellbeing and retention

Structured Empathy gives you the tools to build these outcomes deliberately, not accidentally.

Explore the next page - [Building Blocks](buildingblocks.md) - which considers the four foundations that enables organisations to effectively deliver against strategy with high performance; Structured Empathy Framework is just one key part. 

Altneratively, explore the next section including reviewing the [Maturity Model](../maturity-model/maturitymodel.md) that enables organisations to explore what a culture built on psychological safety looks like.
