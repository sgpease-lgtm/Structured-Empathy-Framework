## Contextual Process 1
# Decision Making Under Ambiguity

## Overview  
Decision Making Under Ambiguity is a structured approach for navigating unclear, incomplete, or conflicting information. It emphasises shared exploration, explicit risk framing, and transparent rationale to prevent anxiety and drift.

## Purpose  
To enable teams to move forward confidently when certainty is not available, ensuring decisions are grounded, collaborative, and psychologically safe.

## Steps  
1. **Clarify what is known**  
   Identify facts, constraints, and non‑negotiables.
2. **Name what is unclear**  
   Surface gaps, uncertainties, and assumptions.
3. **Explore options collaboratively**  
   Generate possibilities without premature judgement.
4. **Frame risks explicitly**  
   Identify potential impacts, mitigations, and trade‑offs.
5. **Agree the rationale**  
   Document why this decision is being made now.
6. **Set a review point**  
   Define when the decision will be revisited as new information emerges.

## Indicators of Good Practice  
- Decisions are made without unnecessary delay  
- Rationale is transparent and shared  
- Team members feel included and informed  

## Common Failure Modes  
- Waiting for perfect information  
- Hidden assumptions driving choices  
- Decisions made privately or opaquely  

## When to Use  
- When information is incomplete  
- During fast‑moving or uncertain situations  
- When teams feel stuck or hesitant
