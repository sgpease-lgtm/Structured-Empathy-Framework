## Foundation Process 8
# User Manual Creation & Maintenance

## Overview  
A process for individuals to articulate how they work—their preferences, triggers, strengths, and non‑negotiables.

## Purpose  
To reduce interpersonal guesswork and accelerate trust by making the implicit explicit.

## Steps
1. **Draft the manual**  
   Capture preferences, strengths, triggers, and boundaries.
2. **Share with your team**  
   Invite questions and clarifications.
3. **Integrate into collaboration**  
   Use it to shape working agreements.
4. **Review periodically**  
   Update as roles or contexts change.
5. **Use it as a reference**  
   Especially during conflict or onboarding.

## Indicators of Good Practice
- Manuals are honest, not performative  
- Teams use them actively  
- Misunderstandings reduce  

## Common Failure Modes
- Manuals becoming static  
- Over‑sharing personal information  
- Treating preferences as entitlements  

## When to Use
- Team formation  
- Leadership transitions  
- Conflict prevention
