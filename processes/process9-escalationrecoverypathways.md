## Foundation Process 9
# Escalation & Recovery Pathways

## Overview  
A structured method for handling breakdowns, breaches of trust, or moments where psychological safety is compromised.

## Purpose  
To provide predictable routes for repair, accountability, and restoration.

## Steps
1. **Identify the breach**  
   Be specific about what happened.
2. **Choose the escalation route**  
   Peer‑to‑peer, mediator, leader, or formal process.
3. **Address the issue directly**  
   Use evidence, not accusation.
4. **Agree on repair actions**  
   Focus on restoring trust, not assigning blame.
5. **Monitor recovery**  
   Ensure commitments are upheld.

## Indicators of Good Practice
- People trust the process  
- Issues are raised early  
- Repair is normalised  

## Common Failure Modes
- Escalation used as punishment  
- Avoiding escalation until too late  
- No follow‑through on repair actions  

## When to Use
- When trust is damaged  
- When behaviour breaches expectations  
- When informal resolution fails
