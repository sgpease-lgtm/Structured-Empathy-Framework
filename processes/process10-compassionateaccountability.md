## Foundation Process 10
# Compassionate Accountability

## Overview  
A process for holding people accountable in a way that protects dignity and supports growth.

## Purpose  
To maintain high standards without fear, blame, or humiliation.

## Steps
1. **Clarify expectations**  
   Ensure the standard is explicit and understood.
2. **Describe the gap using evidence**  
   Avoid character judgements.
3. **Explore underlying drivers**  
   Understand constraints, pressures, or misunderstandings.
4. **Agree on corrective actions**  
   Co‑create a realistic path forward.
5. **Follow up consistently**  
   Reinforce progress and address slippage early.
