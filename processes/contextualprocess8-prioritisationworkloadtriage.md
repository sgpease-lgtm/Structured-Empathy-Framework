## Contextual Process 8
# Prioritisation & Workload Triage

## Overview  
Prioritisation & Workload Triage is a process for handling overload, competing demands, or shifting priorities. It uses transparent criteria and shared decision‑making to avoid burnout and confusion.

## Purpose  
To ensure workload decisions are fair, sustainable, and aligned with organisational goals.

## Steps  
1. **List all current demands**  
   Make the invisible visible.
2. **Apply shared criteria**  
   Use impact, urgency, and risk to guide decisions.
3. **Sequence work collaboratively**  
   Agree what comes first and why.
4. **Communicate trade‑offs**  
   Make consequences explicit.
5. **Review regularly**  
   Adjust as priorities shift.

## Indicators of Good Practice  
- Workload feels manageable and fair  
- Priorities are transparent  
- Teams understand why decisions were made  

## Common Failure Modes  
- Hidden work or unspoken commitments  
- Prioritisation based on loudest voices  
- Overcommitting without acknowledging trade‑offs  

## When to Use  
- Overload or competing deadlines  
- Shifting organisational priorities  
- Team uncertainty about what matters most
