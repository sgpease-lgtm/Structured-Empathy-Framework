title: Structured Empathy Framework Definitions
---
## Definitions  

The following **_Definitions_** are used to bring clarity to the Structured Empathy Framework; they aim to nurture understanding and set expectations.  They act as an good gateway to exploring the key concepts.  

## Core Terms / Definitions
-	**Structured Empathy** - A disciplined method for understanding others that balances emotional insight with operational clarity. It transforms empathy from a vague sentiment into a repeatable, evidence based practice.
-	**Psychological Safety** -  A individuals belief that a group is safe for interpersonal risk taking. It enables people to speak up, ask questions, challenge assumptions, and admit mistakes without fear of humiliation or punishment.
-	**Interpersonal Risk Taking** -  The willingness to say or do something that could expose you to judgement. High psychological safety increases this willingness by reducing the perceived cost of vulnerability.
-	**Mistake Transparency** - The practice of openly acknowledging mistakes so they can be understood and corrected. It treats mistakes as data rather than personal failings.
-	**Inclusive Participation** -  A climate where contributions from all members are actively welcomed and valued. It prevents dominance by a few voices and ensures diverse perspectives shape decisions.
-	**Boundary Safe Challenge** - The ability to question decisions, norms, or authority without crossing into disrespect. It balances candour with professionalism.
-	**Learning Climate** - An environment where experimentation, curiosity, and iteration are encouraged. Psychological safety is the foundation that makes learning behaviours possible.
-	**Mutual Respect** - A shared commitment to treating each other with dignity, even in disagreement. It stabilises the emotional environment so people can take risks constructively.
-	**Constructive Dissent** - Disagreement expressed in a way that strengthens understanding and decision quality. It relies on psychological safety to avoid defensiveness or retaliation.
-	**Underlying Drivers** - The motivations, constraints, and pressures that shape someone’s actions beneath the surface. They often explain behaviour more reliably than stated intentions.
-	**Assumption Audit** - A deliberate check of the beliefs, shortcuts, and narratives you’re bringing into an interaction. It reduces distortion and increases accuracy in understanding others.
-	**Emotional Signal vs Emotional State** -  A distinction between what someone expresses outwardly and what they may actually feel internally. Structured Empathy treats signals as data, not conclusions.
-	**Cognitive Generosity** - A disciplined willingness to assume competence, coherence, and good intent until evidence suggests otherwise. It creates psychological safety without being naïve.
-	**User Manual** An self-written document that explains how a person works, their preferences, triggers, strengths, expectations, and communication patterns. It reduces interpersonal guesswork by making the implicit explicit.
-	**Collaboration Protocols** - Clear guidelines for how individuals or groups likes to coordinate, escalate issues, share updates, and resolve disagreements. They create predictable rhythms that reduce friction and ambiguity.
-	**Strengths & Superpowers** - The capabilities a person consistently brings to a team such as technical, relational, or strategic skills. Naming them helps others know when to lean on or amplify those strengths.
-	**Stress Indicators** - Observable behaviours that signal when someone is overloaded, frustrated, or under pressure. Including them in a User Manual helps teams intervene early and constructively.
-	**Non Negotiables** - Boundaries or values that a person considers essential for healthy collaboration. They protect psychological safety and prevent avoidable conflict.
-	**Feedback Preferences** - How someone prefers to give and receive feedback, including timing, tone, format, and context. Clear preferences make feedback more effective and less emotionally costly.  

## Anti Definitions (What it is not) 
-	**_Not_ Emotional Absorption** - Structured Empathy does not require taking on someone else’s feelings. It focuses on understanding, not internalising.
-	**_Not_ People Pleasing** - It does not mean agreeing, accommodating, or smoothing conflict. It supports clarity and truth, even when uncomfortable.
-	**_Not_ Mind Reading** - It avoids guessing hidden motives or emotions without evidence. It treats uncertainty as a signal to ask better questions.
-	**_Not_ Conflict Avoidance** - It does not shy away from tension. Instead, it uses structured understanding to navigate conflict constructively.
-	**_Not_ Vague Niceness** -  It is not about being “kind” in a superficial sense. It prioritises clarity, honesty, and mutual respect over comfort.

## Distinctions  
-	**Empathy vs Sympathy** - Empathy seeks to understand someone’s internal logic; sympathy focuses on feeling for them. You do not need to sympathise with someone’s views to have empathy with them.
-	**Intent vs Impact** - Intent describes what someone meant; impact describes what actually happened. Both matter, but they must be analysed separately to avoid confusion.
-	**Understanding vs Agreement** -  You can fully understand someone’s perspective without endorsing it. This separation enables honest dialogue without forced alignment.
-	**Clarity vs Certainty** - Clarity is about articulating what is known; certainty is about believing you’re right. Structured Empathy values clarity while remaining open to revision.
-	**Data vs Interpretation** - Data is what you observe; interpretation is the meaning you assign. Keeping them distinct prevents narrative drift.
-	**Support vs Rescue** -  Support empowers someone to act; rescue removes their agency. Structured Empathy favours support that strengthens capability.
-	**Responsibility vs Blame** - Responsibility is forward looking and constructive; blame is backward looking and punitive. Structured empathy uses responsibility to enable progress.
-	**Curiosity vs Intrusion** - Curiosity seeks understanding with consent; intrusion seeks information without regard for boundaries. Structured Empathy stays firmly on the curiosity side.
-	**Honesty vs Brutality** - Honesty communicates truth with care; brutality uses truth as a weapon. Honesty preserves dignity.
