## Foundation Process 6
# Feedback Loops & Reflective Practice

## Overview  
A process for gathering, analysing, and acting on feedback.

## Purpose  
To ensure learning is continuous, evidence‑based, and integrated into behaviour.

## Steps
1. **Gather feedback regularly**  
   Use structured prompts, not ad‑hoc comments.
2. **Analyse patterns**  
   Look for themes, not isolated incidents.
3. **Reflect individually and collectively**  
   Identify what needs to change.
4. **Act on insights**  
   Implement small, visible adjustments.
5. **Close the loop**  
   Communicate what changed and why.

## Indicators of Good Practice
- Feedback is normalised, not feared  
- Improvements are visible  
- People feel heard  

## Common Failure Modes
- Collecting feedback without acting on it  
- Using feedback punitively  
- Ignoring early warning signs  

## When to Use
- After key events  
- During retrospectives  
- When culture begins to drift
