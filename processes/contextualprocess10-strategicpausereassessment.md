## Contextual Process 10
# Strategic Pause & Reassessment

## Overview  
Strategic Pause & Reassessment is a process for stepping back when momentum is carrying the organisation in the wrong direction. It emphasises reflection, reframing, and deliberate re‑entry.

## Purpose  
To prevent drift, enable course correction, and create space for insight.

## Steps  
1. **Call the pause**  
   Name the need to step back without blame.
2. **Reflect collectively**  
   Explore what is working, what isn’t, and why.
3. **Reframe the situation**  
   Identify new perspectives or emerging patterns.
4. **Reassess priorities**  
   Align on what matters most now.
5. **Re‑enter deliberately**  
   Restart with clarity, intention, and shared commitment.

## Indicators of Good Practice  
- Teams feel relieved rather than disrupted  
- Priorities become clearer  
- Decisions feel more intentional  

## Common Failure Modes  
- Pushing forward despite misalignment  
- Treating pauses as failures  
- Restarting without clarity  

## When to Use  
- Signs of drift or misalignment  
- Repeated friction or confusion  
- Moments requiring strategic clarity
