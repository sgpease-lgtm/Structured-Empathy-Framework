# Maturity Model

The Maturity Model forms a core part of the framework, in that it allows organisations to consider in a structured fashion where they are currently, where they are targeting over what time frames, and identify the key gaps they need to address.
In turn, this then allows organisations to consider which parts of the Framework they would like to exploit to approach addressing these gaps, and in turn increase their maturity against the framework.
