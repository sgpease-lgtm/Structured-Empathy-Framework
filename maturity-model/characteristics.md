# Characteristics of Maturity Model levels

The following descriptions outline the characteristics, behaviours, systems, and artefacts you would expect to see at each level of the [Maturity Model](maturitymodel.md). They are written to help leaders diagnose where they are today and what “better” looks like in practice.

## Level 1 - Absent
At this level, psychological safety is not part of the organisational operating system. Positive experiences are dependent on individual leaders.
### Behaviours
-	Leadership behaviours vary wildly; some are supportive, others are unsafe.
-	People self censor because speaking up feels risky.
-	Conflict is avoided, often escalating into blame or silence.
-	Mistakes are hidden, minimised, or punished.
### Systems
-	Standard processes, rituals, or governance structures do not support psychological safety.
-	Meetings, decision making, and delivery rhythms do not protect or encourage speaking up on difficult subjects.
-	No training or shared language on psychological safety, with no expectations and no escalation paths.
### Artefacts
-	No formal tools, frameworks, or guidance exist that focus on psychological safety
-	Organisation relies on intuition or hearsay.
-	Staff describe the environment as unpredictable or unsafe.

This level is defined by absence, inconsistency, and fragility.

## Level 2 - Emerging
The organisation begins to recognise the value of psychological safety, but progress is local, inconsistent, and personality driven.
### Behaviours
-	Some leaders show intent and model empathy, but inconsistently.
-	Teams experience “pockets” of safety around certain individuals.
-	People speak up selectively, depending on who is in the room.
-	Conflict is sometimes handled well, sometimes poorly.
### Systems
-	Basic training incorporating psychological safety and awareness sessions exist, but are generic and not embedded.
-	Some teams experiment with rituals (e.g., check ins, retros), but nothing is standardised.
-	Processes do not reliably hold under pressure or during conflict.
### Artefacts
-	Early language emerges (“safe space”, “speak up”), but without shared definitions.
-	Tools are borrowed externally and used inconsistently.
-	Surveys or feedback mechanisms exist but are not integrated into decision making.

This level is defined by intent without reliability.

## Level 3 - Intentional
The organisation now treats psychological safety as a deliberate capability. Structures, expectations, and feedback loops begin to take shape.
### Behaviours
-	Leaders are trained and measured on how safe their teams feel.
-	People experience more consistent behaviours across multiple teams.
-	Constructive challenge becomes more normalised.
-	Mistakes are discussed openly and used for learning.
### Systems
-	Clear expectations, escalation paths, and behavioural standards are defined.
-	Key rituals (meetings, decision making, conflict processes) are designed to protect safety.
-	Organisation wide surveys and indicators are reviewed and acted upon.
-	Training pathways exist for all staff, not just leaders.
### Artefacts
-	Shared definitions and tools are used consistently.
-	Conflict processes explicitly incorporate psychological safety.
-	Feedback loops begin to influence governance and leadership behaviours.

This level is defined by structure, consistency, and early integration.

## Level 4 - Embedded
Psychological safety is now part of the organisational operating system. It is reliable, resilient, and visible in how the organisation behaves under pressure.
### Behaviours
-	Leaders consistently model, reinforce, and hold others accountable for psychologically safe behaviours.
-	Staff describe high trust, constructive challenge, and predictable interactions.
-	Psychological safety holds even during conflict, change, or high pressure delivery.
-	People proactively raise issues early because they trust the system.
### Systems
-	Psychologically safe processes and behavioural norms are integrated into governance and decision making.
-	Training, coaching, and assessment are regular and expected.
-	Accountability is fair, transparent, and culturally trusted.
-	Feedback loops are reliable and influence operational rhythms.
### Artefacts
-	Tools and language are consistent across the organisation.
-	Psychological safety is visible in documentation, rituals, and decision records.
-	Evidence is used to guide improvements, not just to diagnose problems.

This level is defined by integration, reliability, and resilience.

## Level 5 - Strategic
Psychological safety becomes a strategic capability; a differentiator that strengthens performance, innovation, and organisational resilience.
### Behaviours
-	Leaders actively coach and develop empathy as a core skill.
-	Staff describe psychological safety as part of “how we do things here”.
-	Conflict becomes a source of insight and learning, not a threat.
-	People operate with confidence in all contexts, including the most challenging.
### Systems
-	Psychological safety metrics are reviewed at board level.
-	Insights from lived experience feed back into strategy, governance, and delivery.
-	The organisation continuously improves its tools, language, and practices.
-	Psychological safety shapes decision making, culture, and long term planning.
### Artefacts
-	A shared vernacular is deeply embedded and culturally reinforcing.
-	Tools are refined, extended, and contributed back to the wider community.
-	Evidence is rich, multi layered, and used to drive strategic decisions.
-	Psychological safety is treated as a strategic asset, not a cultural initiative.

This level is defined by mastery, continuous improvement, and strategic leverage.

The next section considers the [Foundation Processes](../processes/foundations.md) that ensure empathy, psychological safety, and clarity are not left to chance, but are enacted through consistent, reliable, and evidence based practice.
