## Contextual Process 5
# High Stakes Feedback Delivery

## Overview  
High Stakes Feedback Delivery is a process for giving feedback that carries significant emotional or organisational weight. It emphasises preparation, consent, and clarity of intent.

## Purpose  
To ensure difficult feedback lands cleanly, respectfully, and without unnecessary harm.

## Steps  
1. **Prepare thoroughly**  
   Clarify the core message and desired outcome.
2. **Seek consent**  
   Ensure the recipient is ready for the conversation.
3. **Deliver the message clearly**  
   Avoid hedging, softening, or ambiguity.
4. **Hold space for reaction**  
   Allow emotional processing without defensiveness.
5. **Agree next steps**  
   Identify actions, support, or follow‑up.

## Indicators of Good Practice  
- The message is understood without confusion  
- Emotional responses are handled with care  
- The relationship remains intact  

## Common Failure Modes  
- Over‑softening the message

- Becoming defensive when emotions arise  

## When to Use  
- Sensitive interpersonal issues  
- Significant behavioural concerns
