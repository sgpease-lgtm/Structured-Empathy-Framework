# Maturity Model

The Maturity Model forms a core part of the framework, in that it allows organisations to consider in a structured fashion where they are currently, where they are targeting over what time frames, and identify the key gaps they need to address.
In turn, this then allows organisations to consider which parts of the Framework they would like to exploit to approach addressing these gaps, and in turn increase their maturity against the framework.

Psychological safety depends on individual leaders.                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                Senior leaders demonstrate intent, and some model empathetic behaviours.                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                     All leaders are trained and measured against the Structured Empathy Framework. Clear expectations and escalation paths exist. Leaders begin to model and reinforce psychological safety more consistently.                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                      Leaders consistently demonstrate the behaviours required to support psychological safety.                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                              Leaders actively coach, steward, and develop empathy as a capability.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|    **Operational Culture & Rhythms**   |                                    How organisational processes, rituals, and behavioural norms embed psychological safety into the way the organisation operates — including meetings, decision‑making, governance, and how people behave under pressure or in conflict.                                   |                                                                    Psychological safety is not reflected in the way the business operates. Meetings, rituals, and decision‑making processes do not support or protect it.                                                                   |                                                                                                                           Use of psychological safety practices is inconsistent, appearing in some meetings or conflict situations but not reliably across the organisation.                                                                                                                          |                                                                                             Key processes, rituals, and meeting norms are designed to assure and protect psychological safety. People begin to experience more consistent behaviours.                                                                                             |                                                                                                                      Processes and behavioural norms are embedded and integrated into governance, decision‑making, and operational rhythms. Psychological safety is reliably maintained, even under pressure.                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                            Leadership drives accountability for consistently following these rhythms. The operating system is continuously improved, and psychological safety becomes a cultural expectation and source of learning.                                                                                                                           |
|        **Organisation & People**       | How the organisation builds and reinforces the behaviours, skills, and experiences that underpin psychological safety — including how leaders and staff are held accountable, how empathy and compassion are taught and developed, and how people experience psychological safety in their day‑to‑day work. |                                                             There is no formal training, no accountability, and no systemic support for empathy or psychological safety. Staff describe an unsafe and unpredictable environment.                                                            |                                                                                                              Basic, untailored training exists. Individual leaders encourage accountability informally. Staff experience pockets of psychological safety around certain leaders or teams.                                                                                                             |                                                                             Structured training and learning pathways exist for all staff. Clear expectations and escalation paths are defined. Staff describe psychological safety within and across multiple teams.                                                                             |                                                                                                    Training, coaching, and assessment are regular and consistent. Accountability is integrated into performance and governance. Staff describe high levels of trust, constructive challenge, and reliable psychological safety.                                                                                                    |                                                                                                 Empathy, compassion, and psychological safety skills form a core organisational capability. Accountability is fair, trusted, and culturally reinforcing. Staff describe psychological safety as a strategic asset that strengthens performance and resilience.                                                                                                 |
|             **Enablement**             |                                    How the organisation equips people with the tools, shared language, and practical supports needed to apply Structured Empathy consistently — including in difficult situations such as conflict, challenge, or high‑pressure delivery.                                   |              Tools are used inconsistently by individuals. There is no shared vernacular and no common understanding of empathy, compassion, or psychological safety. People lack the practical supports needed to apply Structured Empathy, especially in difficult situations             |                                                                               Tools are used widely but inconsistently. The organisation recognises key terms and has basic awareness of the concepts. Some leaders attempt to apply Structured Empathy in challenging moments, but practice is uneven and unsupported.                                                                               |                                         Tools are integrated into business‑as‑usual processes. Shared definitions are consistently used and understood. Conflict processes incorporate psychological safety, and people have clearer guidance on how to apply Structured Empathy in difficult situations.                                         |                                                                                    Tools are consistently used across the organisation. Shared language becomes part of communication norms. Lived experiences show psychological safety is maintained even in difficult or high‑pressure situations, supported by reliable tools and practices.                                                                                   |                                                                                  Tools are actively improved and contributed back into the framework. Shared vernacular is consistent organisation‑wide. Conflict becomes a source of learning, and insights refine the framework. Structured Empathy is confidently applied in all contexts, including the most challenging.                                                                                  |

The organisation relies on anecdote, intuition, or individual leader perception. Staff describe an unsafe or unpredictable environment, and there is no evidence‑based understanding of impact on people or delivery. | The organisation conducts basic or local surveys that touch on aspects of psychological safety, but behaviours and responses are inconsistent and not tied to decision‑making. Some teams gather informal feedback, but there is no systematic analysis or follow‑through. Staff experience pockets of psychological safety around certain leaders or teams, with limited impact on broader outcomes. | The organisation runs regular, organisation‑wide surveys and collects other basic indicators of psychological safety. Data is reviewed and discussed, and early feedback loops begin to influence behaviours and team practices. Staff describe psychological safety within and across multiple teams, though experiences and impacts still vary. | Psychological safety is consistently enacted and evidenced across the organisation. Measurement is reliable and integrated into feedback loops. Indicators inform governance, decision‑making, and leadership behaviours. Lived experiences confirm that psychological safety is maintained even during conflict or change. Staff describe high trust, constructive challenge, and positive impacts on delivery and collaboration. | The organisation uses data‑driven insights and lived experience to continuously improve Structured Empathy practices. Psychological safety metrics are reviewed at board level and treated as strategic indicators. Feedback loops are rapid, trusted, and culturally embedded. Psychological safety is seen as a strategic asset that accelerates innovation, resilience, and delivery, and the organisation actively refines its approach based on outcomes. |
