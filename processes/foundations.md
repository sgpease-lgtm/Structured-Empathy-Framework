# Foundation Processes
Integrating compassion, empathy and the foundations for psychological safety in organisational processes forms a critical enabler for successful delivery of the Structured Empathy Framework. 

However, there are also a number of deliberately simple, repeatable, and underlying processes - designed to hold under pressure - that rather than forming a part of the organisational operational, HR, or governance processes – are aimed for everyday and ubiquitous use in the way the organisation works ‘on the ground’. 

They ensure that empathy, psychological safety, and clarity are not left to chance, but are enacted through consistent, reliable, and evidence based practice. 

These processes are:

### [1 - Observation & Evidence Gathering](process1-observationevidencegathering.md)
A disciplined process for grounding understanding in what is observable rather than what is assumed.  
It focuses on behaviours, language, context, and patterns, creating a shared factual basis before interpretation begins.
What it enables:
- Reduces projection and drift in narrative
- Creates a shared reality
- Supports fair, evidence based conversations

### [2 - Assumption Surfacing & Testing](process2-assumptionsurfacingtesting.md)
A structured method for identifying the stories, shortcuts, and interpretations we bring into interactions.  
It encourages people to label assumptions explicitly and test them collaboratively rather than treating them as truth.
What it enables:
- Humility in interpretation
- Reduced conflict caused by misattribution
- More accurate understanding of underlying drivers

### [3 - Perspective Taking & Clarification](process3-perspectivetakingclarification.md)
A repeatable process for understanding someone’s internal logic, constraints, and motivations.  
It uses curiosity, consent, and structured inquiry to build an accurate picture of how the other person sees the situation.
What it enables:
- Empathy for others perspectives
- Reduced defensiveness
- Stronger alignment and collaboration

### [4 - Boundary Setting & Maintenance](process4-boundarysettingmaintenance.md)
A process for articulating, negotiating, and respecting boundaries—both personal and organisational.  
It ensures that empathy does not collapse into over identification or blurred expectations.
What it enables:
- Sustainable collaboration
- Psychological safety
- Clear expectations and reduced friction

### [5 - Constructive Challenge & Conflict Navigation](process5-constructivechallengeconflictnavigation.md)
A structured approach to raising concerns, disagreeing, and navigating tension without damaging dignity or trust.  
It emphasises candour delivered with care, and uses conflict as a source of insight rather than threat.
What it enables:
- Healthy dissent
- Better decisions
- Reliability under pressure

### [6 - Feedback Loops & Reflective Practice](process6-feedbackloopsreflectivepractice.md)
A process for gathering, analysing, and acting on feedback - both interpersonal and organisational.  
It ensures that insights lead to adaptation, and that learning is continuous rather than episodic.
What it enables:
- Continuous improvement
- Evidence based leadership
- Early detection of cultural drift

### [7 - Ritualised Communication & Meeting Norms](process7-ritualisedcommunicationmeetingnorms.md)
A set of predictable, repeatable communication patterns that embed psychological safety into everyday operations.  
This includes check ins, retrospectives, decision making protocols, and conflict safe meeting formats.
What it enables:
- Consistency across teams
- Reduced interpersonal risk
- Reliable behaviour even under stress

### [8 - User Manual Creation & Maintenance](process8-usermanualcreationmaintenance.md)
A process for individuals to articulate how they work including their preferences, triggers, strengths, and non negotiables.  
It reduces interpersonal guesswork and accelerates trust by making the implicit explicit.
What it enables:
- Faster alignment
- Reduced friction
- More intentional collaboration

### [9 - Escalation & Recovery Pathways](process9-escalationrecoverypathways.md)
A structured method for handling breakdowns, breaches of trust, or moments where psychological safety is compromised.  
It provides predictable routes for repair, accountability, and restoration.
What it enables:
- Trust that issues will be handled fairly
- Reduced fear of speaking up
- A culture where repair is normalised

### [10 - Compassionate Accountability](process10-compassionateaccountability.md)
A process for holding people (including leaders) accountable in a way that protects dignity and supports growth.  
It balances compassion with clarity, ensuring that expectations are upheld without resorting to blame.
What it enables:
- Fairness and trust
- High standards without fear
- A culture where accountability is constructive

The next page - [Contextual Processes](contextual.md) - explores approaches that can be used in those difficult moments, when a positive culture is truly embedded.

Alternatively, explore the next section looking at an [Empathy Map](../tools/empathymaps.md) tool that provides a structured template to aid development of empathy for others.
