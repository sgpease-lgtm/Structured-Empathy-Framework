# Indicator Sample Survey

All scored questions use a 1–5 scale:  
1 = Strongly disagree  
5 = Strongly agree


## Scored Questions (1–5)

1. People in my team speak up and contribute without needing to be prompted.  
2. I feel comfortable asking questions, even when I am unsure or disagree.  
3. Risks and issues are raised early rather than being hidden or delayed.  
4. Disagreements in my team are handled respectfully and constructively.  
5. I regularly receive feedback from peers, not just leaders.  
6. Conversations in my team include a balanced range of voices.  
7. I feel able to ask for help without fear of judgement.  
8. We share early drafts or incomplete work without worrying about criticism.  
9. I observe regular positive activities such as check‑ins, appreciation, or support.  
10. Conflicts are resolved in a timely and constructive way.
