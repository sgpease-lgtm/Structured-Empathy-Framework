## Leading & Lagging Indicators of Pscyhological Safety

The core cultural outcome that the Structure Empathy Framework aims to develop is level of Psychological safety across the organisation, that in turn enables higher performance and innovation, stronger collaboration and trust, better decision making, more resilient teams, reduced conflict and rework, and critically - improved wellbeing and retention. 

By its nature it is difficult to measure, however recognising the key indictors is the first step to consider measurement and interpreation of results.  This section considers Leading and Lagging indicators of Psychological Safety, and futher signals that blend behaviour, trust, and team dynamics.


## Leading Indicators of Psychological Safety
Early signals that psychological safety is present or increasing.

| Indicator | Description | Qualitative / Quantitative | How to Measure |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| Open participation in meetings | People speak up without prompting and share ideas freely | Qualitative | Observation, trained facilitator feedback |
| Questions asked without fear | Team members ask clarifying or challenging questions | Qualitative | Retrospective reflections, post meeting questions via other means |
| Early surfacing of risks | Risks, issues, and uncertainties are raised proactively | Quantitative | Quanitity of risks raised early vs late in cycle; classification of earliest oppourtunity to identify late risks |
| Constructive disagreement | Disagreements occur respectfully and productively | Qualitative | Observation, reduction requests for low level conflict support |
| Peer‑to‑peer feedback | Feedback flows sideways, not only top‑down | Quantitative | Frequency of peer feedback in retros or check‑ins |
| Inclusive turn‑taking | Conversations show balanced contribution across voices | Quantitative | Observation, participation distribution in meetings |
| Volunteering for stretch work | People opt into challenging tasks without fear of failure | Quantitative | Measure of volunteers for complex tasks |
| Asking for help | Individuals openly request support when stuck | Quantitative | Frequency of requests for help |
| Sharing incomplete work | Drafts, prototypes, and early thinking are shared | Qualitative | Observation, team collaboration logs |
| Positive micro‑interactions | Small signals of trust: checking in, offering support | Qualitative | Observation |


## Lagging Indicators of Psychological Safety
Outcomes that show whether psychological safety has been sustained or eroded.

| Indicator | Description | Qualitative / Quantitative | How to Measure |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| Retention and turnover | High safety correlates with lower unwanted turnover | Quantitative | Annual retention/exit data |
| Escalation frequency | Low safety leads to more escalations and late stage conflict | Quantitative | Number of escalations per quarter |
| Rework and defects | Fear of speaking up leads to avoidable errors | Quantitative | Defect counts |
| Innovation output | Safe teams generate more ideas and improvements | Qualitative | Innovation proposals, experiements, hackathons |
| Conflict avoidance | Silence, withdrawal, or passive agreement | Qualitative | Observation, retro themes |
| Burnout indicators | Stress, exhaustion, or emotional withdrawal | Qualitative/Quantitative | Wellbeing surveys, sickness leave data |
| Trust survey scores | Direct measurement of trust and safety sentiment | Quantitative | Team surveys |
| Quality of conflict resolution | Whether conflicts resolve constructively or remain unresolved | Qualitative | Mediation notes |
| Time to raise issues | Longer delays indicate reduced safety | Qualitative | Reported period from discovery to reporting |
| Exit interview themes | Departing staff cite fear, conflict, or lack of voice | Qualitative | Exit interview analysis |


## Behavioural and Interaction Indicators
Cross‑cutting signals that blend behaviour, trust, and team dynamics.

| Indicator | Description | Qualitative / Quantitative | How to Measure |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| Psychological availability | People show up engaged, not guarded | Qualitative | Observation, 1:1 conversations |
| Responsiveness to mistakes | Mistakes are treated as learning, not blame | Qualitative | Observations, esclations with blame |
| Cross‑team collaboration quality | Safety enables smoother collaboration across boundaries | Qualitative | Observation |
| Meeting energy and tone | Tone is open, curious, and respectful | Qualitative | Observation, trained facilitator notes |
| Participation in retros | High engagement in reflection and improvement | Quantitative | Attendance, contribution counts |
| Follow‑through on commitments | Trust reinforced by reliable delivery | Quantitative | Delivery metrics, commitments met vs missed |
| Rituals | Regular check‑ins, appreciations, and other Structured Empathy practices | Quantitative | Frequency of rituals used |
